Stage 2: Free fall.
Stage 3: Land.

Scene types:
	s-1 -> Hanging from plane mode
	i.e Hanging from plane before jumping

	s-2 -> Freefall mode
	i.e Regular free-fall form (belly down, arms/legs out)

	s-3 -> Dive mode
	i.e Like an arrow (head down, arms tucked in to reduce air resistance)

	s-4 -> Parachute mode
	i.e Deploy parachute (user controlled ??)

	s-5 -> Standing/Landed mode
	i.e On the ground, parachute off (End run)
