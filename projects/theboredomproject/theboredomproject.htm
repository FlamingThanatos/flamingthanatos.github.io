                    <h4 class="subtitle">What <i>is</i> the Boredom Project?</h4>
                    <p>The Boredom Project is just as the name ssggests: a project, or a multitude of projects, born from boredom. Everything on this website is spontaneous, random, and probably small, unlike many of the project on the main website. In other words, it's the result of a 16-year-old without friends or a life.</p>
                    
                    <h4 class="subtitle">What to expect on The Boredom Project</h4>
                    <p>Take a guess. Okay, I'll tell you. Usually, the Boredom Project projects [sic] will be small, classical, and probably simple. Don't expect crazy, new, innovative indie-type games to appear. That'll still be uploaded to the main site (shameless plug to yet-to-be-finished Lone Soldier game).</p>
                    
                    <h4 class="subtitle">Other junk</h4>
                    <p> These projects are BOREDOM inspired projects. So, depending on how bored I am, I may pump out several projects in a week. I might also be pre-occupied and not post a single project in several months. So don't go expecting to see new stuff every month or even every day. Also, none of the projects here are subject to updates or bug fixes. I MAY fix bugs or add features, but don't count on it. OK, I'm done rambling. Check out my Boredom Projects, and for the love of something, use proper grammar.</p>
